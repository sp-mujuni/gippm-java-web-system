# GIPPM Business Automation Java System

This project is intended to demonstrate process automation for businesses, through integration of customizable modules.
--
+ The system is divided into three parts: the shop, the admin dashboard, and the staff dashboard.
+ A sample of three production lines was used; short term, mid term and long term.
+ A sample of four milk products is being produced (milk, butter, cheese, yoghurt).
+ Total stock is calculated and updated in each production line based on the size specified for the long term line.
+ There is an option of rotating staff around the production lines, basing on highest sales made.
+ No staff member loses their job during rotation.
